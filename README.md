# Project Description: MMITSS 
 The Multi-Modal Intelligent Traffic Signal System (MMITSS) project is part of the Connected Vehicle Pooled Fund Study (CV PFS) entitled “Program to Support the Development and Deployment of Connected Vehicle System Applications.” The CV PFS was developed by a group of state and local transportation agencies and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) serves as the lead agency and is assisted by the University of Virginia’s Center for Transportation Studies, which serves as the technical and administrative lead for the PFS.

The USDOT identified six mobility application bundles under the Dynamic Mobility Applications (DMA) program for the connected vehicle environment where high-fidelity data from vehicles, infrastructure, pedestrians, etc. can be shared through wireless communications. Each bundle contains a set of related applications that are focused on similar outcomes. Since a major focus of the CV PFS members –who are the actual owners and operators of transportation infrastructure –lies in traffic signal related applications, the CV PFS team is leading the project entitled “Multi-Modal Intelligent Traffic Signal System” in cooperation with US DOT’s Dynamic Mobility Applications Program. As one of the six DMA application bundles, MMITSS includes five applications: Intelligent Traffic Signal Control (I-SIG), Transit Signal Priority (TSP), Mobile Accessible Pedestrian Signal System (PED-SIG), Freight Signal Priority (FSP), and Emergency Vehicle Preemption (PREEMPT).The MMITSS prototype was developed based on traffic controllers using the NTCIP communications protocol and new algorithms for providing priority control (emergency vehicle, transit, and truck priority) and intelligent signal control (e.g. adaptive control using connected vehicle data). 

The current implementation of MMITSS, based on the CV PFS Phase 3 – Deployment Readiness project, has been developed to be deployed on a variety of hardware platforms for both vehicles and at intersections. The Figure below shows the current MMITSS architecture. One of the objectives of the Phase 3 project was for the software to be hardware agnostic so that any vendor’s roadside units (RSU) and onboard units (OBU) could be interfaced to the processors.

The MMITSS Architecture includes OBUs and RSUs that provide wireless communications. The current communications is based on DSRC, but the FHWA RSU 4.1 Interface can support other communication technologies when they are available. Testing has occurred with RSUs and OBUs from Savari and Cohda however, the Savari OBU doesn’t support the RSU 4.1 Interface so these OBUs are only used for passenger vehicles that broadcast Basic Safety Messages (BSM). 

Associated with each RSU and OBU are the MMITSS Roadside Processor (MRP) and the MMITSS Vehicle-side Processor (VSP) where the core MMITSS software components are hosted. Both MRP and VSP have Message Transceivers that are responsible for encoding and decoding J2735 2016 messages into and from defined JSON messages that are used internally to MMITSS. If the standard changes or the encoding/decoding changes from UPER only the Message Transceivers have to be updated. Similarly, if the NTCIP standard for the traffic signal controller changes, such as the new NTCIP 1202 version 3.0, the changes only have to be made in the SNMP Engine. The components use common libraries that are available in the mmitss-common GitHub repository (https://github.com/mmitss/mmitss-common) including the MAP Engine and message library that encodes and decodes BSM, MAP, SPaT, SRM, and SSM messages. 

The MRP components include:
* *Priority Request Server* and *Solver* that implement the MMITSS Priority Control logic and determines a traffic signal schedule that accommodates a set of active priority requests (Zamanipour, M., Head, K.L., Feng, Y. and Khoshmagham, S. Efficient Priority Control Model for Multimodal Traffic Signals. Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 2016. 2557(1): 86-99)
* *Trajectory Aware* that processes data from the BSM for performance measures and the adaptive traffic control component (I-SIG)
* *Traffic Control* (I-SIG) adaptive traffic signal control (not included in this release)
* *Traffic Control Interface* (TCI) that is responsible for taking the priority schedule and applying commands to make the traffic signal controller execute the desired schedule (uses NTCIP HOLD, FORCE-OFF, CALL, and OMIT commands)
* *SNMPEngine* which translates the TCI commands into NTCIP objects to send to the traffic signal controller
* *Performance Data Collector* that captures and logs system performance data (e.g. message counts, priority events granted and rejected, etc.)
* *MMITSS Web Interface* that allows a user to check the status, review and clear logs, and start and stop MMITSS components (using supervisorctl) and edit the system configuration parameters (e.g. IP addresses of the host MRP, RSU, Traffic Signal Controller, ports for socket communications, and other key MMITSS parameters)

The VSP components include:
* *Priority Request Generator* that is responsible for locating the vehicle on a MAP, determining the desired time of service, and forming a Signal Request Message (SRM) that requests priority service
* *Performance Data Collector* that captures and logs system performance data (e.g. message counts, priority events granted and rejected, etc.)
* *MMITSS Web Interface* that allows a user to check the status, review and clear logs, and start and stop MMITSS components (using supervisorctl) and edit the system configuration parameters (e.g. IP addresses of the host VSP, OBU, ports for socket communications, and other key MMITSS parameters)
* External to the VSP is a *MMITSS HMI* display and *HMI Controller* that can be executed on a laptop to allow visualization of SPaT data, vehicle data, SSM data, received MAPs, and status of the vehicle being on a MAP and sending an SRM

# Prerequisites

Other system requirements are defined in /docs/mmitss-deployment/mmitss-build-docker-image.docx

# Usage

## Building

Instructions for building MMITSS are in the /docs/mmitss-deployment/mmitss-build-docker-image.docx file 

## Testing

Tests are provided for many of the MMITSS components, but they are not currently automated. Where specific tests are provided, an input generator and output receiver (if used) is provided. For example see /src/mrp/traffic-controller-interface/tests or /src/mrp/priority-request-solver/test. Additional test scripts and automated testing are planned in future sprints.
